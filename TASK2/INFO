# TASK 2
What is SPIKE in RISCV?
A RISC-V ISA is a simulator, enabling the testing and analysis of RISC-V programs without the need for actual hardware.
Spike is a free, open-source C++ simulator for the RISC-V ISA that models a RISC-V core and cache system. It can be used to run programs and a Linux kernel, and can be a starting point for running software on a RISC-V target.
What is pk (Proxy Kernel)?
The RISC-V Proxy Kernel, pk , is a lightweight application execution environment that can host statically-linked RISC-V ELF binaries.

Testing the Spike Simulator
The objective is to execute the sum1ton.c program using both the gcc compiler and the riscv compiler, ensuring that both compilers produce identical output on the terminal. To compile the code with the gcc compiler,
```gcc sum1ton.c  
./a.out ```

And to compile the code using RISCV Compiler
```spike pk sum1ton.o```

RISCV Objdump with -Ofast
```riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o 
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less ```

Debugging the Assembly Language Program of sum1ton.c
Open the Objdump of code by using the following command
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o | less 


Open the debugger in another terminal by using the following command.
$ spike -d pk sum_1ton.o
